# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Overview
This week, a Colorado Board of Elections employee has asked our team to assist with an election audit of a recent local congressional election.

### Purpose
Our team is tasked with providing the following data to complete the election audit:
1. The total number of votes cast.
2. The largest turnout by county
3. A complete list of candidates who received votes
4. The total number of votes each candidate received.
5. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
6. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

### Resources
- Data Source: election_result.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code, 1.68.1

## Election Audit Summary
### Audit Overview
Our team utilized one a proprietary Python script *(PyPoll_Challenge.py)* to breakdown the election voting data that had been tabulated in a csv file as provided by the Colorado Board of Elections Congressional District.  The csv file contained a summary of all counted votes by hand, machine or computer.
Using various techniques to breakdown, group and calculate voting results, our team was able to deliver an accurate and trustworthy audit of the election results.  The program utilizes the voting data to provide an analysis of the voting results for your Congressional District.  This program has the necessary security and permission tools to (1) log and track what changes are done to the script and (2) ensure bias cannot be introduced into the data breakdown and calculations.

### Business Proposal
It is our belief, that given the opportunity to continue to demonstrate our value-added with our script to  audit election results, we can escale up our script to serve the increasing demands for voting accuracy and accountability.  This script would need a few modifications to be able to be used in any election with the same level of accuracy and dependability.  Specifically, we can offer the following ideas:
1. Change the data source (file) for the next county, city, state or federal election.
2. Update the script to include a breakdown of votes for each candidate per county, region, state. 
3. The source file could include demographic information that can be accessed and broken down by adding a few more lines of code to look for specific groupings and/or leanings by candidate

In summary, there are many applications that we envision our script can be used in the future and we hope you will consider using our services for future election audits.  It has been our pleasure to deliver these results and we look forward to any future engagements.


## Challenge Overview
This challenge took a long time to go through as I did not expect the Module to take so many hours to complete.  That being said, I'm glad I learned a lot of skills and I look forward to utilizing these in the coming weeks and in the future.
Secondly, I believe I need to continue to practice these newly learned skills as to now forget.
